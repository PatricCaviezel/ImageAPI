# Image API

## Description

This is a porject I'm working on during work. It's purpose is to improve my R and node.js skills aswell as getting more into reporting. The project is a webpage that takes data inserted by the user via form or csv file and sends it to a R script with a node.js API. The r script makes a diagram out of the data provided by the user and sends it back to the user.

## To Do

- Take input from csv
- send back the image after creation
- save a buffer of the image into a database
- somehow implement ruby
- make a better webpage
- validation for data sent by user
